Exercise 01

Scenario 1:  Implement the blog post delete functionality.
hint - you may try to delete elements from the blogs array

Scenario 2: Implement 5-star rating feature. When a user clicks on a star, all the stars up to that rating need to be highlighted. If the user clicks on the same star raring, highlight has to be removed or if the user clicks on a different star, it has to be updated with the new rating.
hint - you may maintain an additional property in the blogs array to keep track of the ratings for each array
for start element you can use the font awesome icons - https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon/star
you may follow the same approach we used to import fonts, to import font awesome to your project - https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/examples/
